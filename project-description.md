# Project: MARCO

## Introduction
MARCO is a smart shopping assistant designed to help users make informed purchasing decisions while tracking the nutritional content of food products and managing their kitchen inventory. The system aims to simplify the shopping experience by offering personalized shopping lists, price comparisons, and real-time inventory management.

## The Problem
Modern consumers are often overwhelmed by the variety of food products available and the need to manage their dietary goals. Additionally, keeping track of what’s in the fridge, when products expire, and how much is left can be a hassle. Users need a system that not only helps them make healthy and cost-effective purchasing decisions but also tracks their nutrition intake and manages their kitchen inventory to reduce food waste.

## The Idea
The MARCO system will track each food product’s macros (proteins, carbs, fats) and monitor the quantities of products left in the fridge. Users can generate shopping lists based on their dietary goals and inventory, compare prices across stores, and receive alerts when products are running low or nearing expiration. The system will also offer personalized nutrition advice and suggest recipes based on available ingredients.

## Core Features

1. **Price Comparison and Review Analysis**
   - Helps users compare prices across different stores and online platforms.
   - Analyzes product reviews and suggests the best options based on user preferences.

2. **Macro Tracking and Nutrition Information**
   - Tracks the nutritional content (macros like proteins, carbs, fats) of food products as users add them to their shopping lists or buy them.
   - Allows users to set dietary goals (e.g., daily calorie intake, protein targets) and monitors how the purchased foods contribute to these goals.

3. **Fridge Inventory Management**
   - Automatically updates the quantity of each product in the fridge after shopping.
   - Users can manually or via scanning (using barcodes or QR codes) update the inventory when consuming products.
   - Provides alerts when products are running low or nearing their expiration date, and suggests recipes using remaining ingredients.

4. **Shopping List and Replenishment Notifications**
   - Generates shopping lists based on what’s left in the fridge, the user’s dietary goals, and upcoming meals.
   - Sends notifications when it’s time to restock certain items or when there are deals on frequently bought products.

5. **Integration with Meal Planning**
   - Sync with a meal planning tool to automatically generate shopping lists based on planned meals.
   - Suggest recipes based on current inventory to minimize waste.

6. **Voice Assistant Integration**
   - Users can add items to their shopping list, check inventory, or inquire about nutritional information using voice commands.

7. **Augmented Reality (AR) for Fridge Management**
   - Use augmented reality (AR) to visualize what’s in the fridge, showing quantities and suggesting recipes based on what’s available.
