# Project B

## Introdcution
You have been approached by a client who has an idea for a system they want to develop that would facilitate and promote reusable coffee cups, without the user having to carry and clean their cup themselves. The company has developed bio-degradable RFID tags and has partnered with a company that produces high-quality reusable coffee cups. They developed a coffee cup with an embedded RFID tag that can be individually tracked using off-the-shelf RFID scanners. 

## The problem as they see it

The company has a mature product - a trackable reusable coffee cup - but would like to extend its business into using this technology to provide a coffee cup swap service to local and independent coffee shops. The idea is that people can "buy a cup", which is actually a subscription, which entitles them to the use of a coffee cup at any of the participating coffee shops, and drop it at any of the participating coffee shops. Or at collection points that will be placed in strategically selected points, such as train stations, shopping centres, and libraries. There is no need to take the cup home or clean it. You can take your coffee, have it while you go shopping or travel by train, and leave it at another coffee shop or collection point.

For this product, they like to develop an app that allows users to manage and view their subscriptions. The app can be used at participating coffee shops to use a set number of coffee cups. The coffee shop owner would have to scan both the cup and the app when a cup is "borrowed", and the cup when it is returned. They are open to suggestions on how this "borrowing" and "returning" would work in practice, and how a user would buy their first cup.

The company has an agreement with a university to start a pilot project on its campus, and all coffee shops on campus signed on to the project. The client would employ a sales team to oversee the current subscriptions. They would need an up-to-date overview of how many cups were sold, and which user uses has borrowed how many cups. It should include a system to prevent abuse by users.

## The idea

The idea is to implement a system and an app that tracks cups and manages subscriptions. The sales team should furthermore have up-to-date information. e.g. it should also allow them to identify users who borrow but do not return. It should include a subsystem, that permits coffee shops to create their own loyalty program for coffee sales, e.g. buy 6 coffees, get one free.

## Your responsibility

Your team is in contact with a group of stakeholders. Your task is to plan the software requirements for the new system â€“ which may or may not require the deployment of new hardware.

Note, that this project is related to the other project. Be aware that you develop requirements for your project, and not for the other project, or both projects. That is why it is important to define the scope of a project early. And stick to it.
