   - **Installation**: Download and install from [Visual Studio Code official site](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
   
   - **Recommended Extensions**:
     - **ESLint**: For code linting and maintaining code quality.
     - **Prettier**: For consistent code formatting.
     - **Live Server**: For launching a development local server with live reload feature.
     - **Node.js Extension Pack**: For better Node.js and JavaScript development.

4. **Git**: Version control system to clone repositories and manage code versions.
