# Assignment 2

There are two linked assignments. Assignment 1 and Assignment 2. The aim of these assignments is to get you to investigate a problem area while clearly and succinctly describing the problems and also proposing a solution. A lot of the assignment time will involve investigation, discussion and some research rather than coding / writing - in fact, there will be little to no coding.

## Premise (SDD team)

You have been made responsible for developing the Implementation Planning and Initial Design for a major software project. You have access to a fairly detailed requirements document and if necessary the authors of that document (the SRs team).  This simulates a common situation in software development -- someone has spent time preparing the requirements documentation, and now you need to take that document and plan the implementation. Your task is to develop parts of a detailed implementation planning document, a detailed plan for how you would test the software, and the beginning of the project plan.

## Stakeholders (SRS team)
You are now the stakeholders of this other project. And of course, the authors of the SRS that the SDD team is using. So, please help the SDD team by providing them with all the necessary resources. Please respond to any request for clarification.

## Deliverables

### SDD team 
As a member of the team of the SDD team, we expect you to:
 * As a team write an SDD document. A PDF version has to be uploaded on iLearn. Note, for assignment 2 we will use the peer assessment feature of iLearn to scale the marks.
 * Prepare a group presentation of about 5 minutes. Presentations will take place in week 13. Upload the slide deck to the deliverables folder. A copy has to be uploaded on iLearn.
 * Complete the individual reflection on iLearn. 

### Stakeholder (SRS team)
As a stakeholder for the other project, we expect you to:
 * Cooperate with the other team, and respond to their questions.
 * Hand over any resource they may need from your SRS repo.

## Resources
Please use and read the following
* The file [project-description.md](project-description.md) for the *project description*. **NOTE: PLEASE READ AND USE  THIS ONE.**
* The file [SDD.md](deliverables/SDD.md) for the SDD.
* The folder [deliverables](deliverables/) for uploading your presentation slides.
* The folder [third-party-resources](third-party-resources/) to record and document any third-party resource.
* The folder [minutes](minutes/) to keep minutes of the meeting with the stakeholders and other important meetings.

## How to work with the provided SRS
An SRS should ensure that requirements are correct, feasible, prioritised, verifiable, complete, uniquely identifiable, consistent, modifiable and traceable. Of course, not every SRS is perfect (in fact, almost no SRS is really perfect!) and you may need to make some careful choices about what to do about imperfections. 

If there are very very many requirements provided for you, then in assignment 2 you should probably pick one group of requirements in the provided SRS and outline an implementation and test plan for those. Be sure to think about the different types of tests you can perform for functional and non-functional requirements and choose a broad enough set of requirements.

On the other hand, if your partner provides you with a document with relatively ill-defined requirements, you will need to do your best to work with what you have, and if necessary extend the requirements. And you may (not) be surprised that this also happens in real life.

You may be asking "What do you really want us to do?" There is a great deal of room for creativity, just like with assignment 1. This isn't a find-the-right-answer assignment, and also not a "where are the precise guidelines" type of assignment. It's a mixture of studying carefully what information and specifications you do have and thinking creatively about the problems you have been presented with. There are many different good answers that you as a team could come up with. And that can make the job very interesting and very much fun.

However, try to be as realistic as you can. Creativity is not about wild fantasies. But problem statements will never cover all the details that you might care about. You, and your team, are free to make reasonable assumptions about things. Make sure that they are reasonable, and state them clearly in your submissions so that the marker can understand. And before you start making assumptions, be sure that you've done all you can to find out how things you are wondering about really do work in the real world.
