# Deliverables

* Please create your SDD in the file [SDD.md](SDD.md).
* Please copy the SRS you received into the file [SRS.md](SRS.md).
* Please upload the slides of your group presentation to this directory.
* Don't forget to upload a PDF version of the SRS and a copy of the presentation slides on iLearn.

## Note
We set up GitHub such that it automatically converts your file SDD.md to PDF.
* **This is an experimental feature, at least for us**
* You can use it for your submission. If you like the PDF, upload that on iLearn. But, you don't have to.
* If this for some reason does not work, no worries. Just print your SDD the usual way to PDF. 
* You can use also tools such as the [Markdown Formatter](https://jsonformatter.org/markdown-formatter) to remove issues that may hinder PDF generation.
* If you want to include jpg or png pictures, upload them to this *deliverable* directory, and include them as described [here](https://marinegeo.github.io/2018-08-10-adding-images-markdown/).
* But again, if it for some reason doesn't work, no worries. Just print the markdown to PDf, and upload that.
