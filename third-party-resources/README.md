# Third-party Resources

Use this file to document **all** third-party resources that you used.
* For scientific papers, include the title, the authors, the publication, and a DOI, or ISBN.
* For websites include the title, the authors or organisation, the URL, and an *accessed-at* date. For reference, store a screenshot or pdf printout in [this directory](./)
* For videos include the title, the authors or organisation, the URL, and the *accessed-at* date.
* For desktop tools that you use, include the name of the tool, the version number the name publisher, and the URL to the publisher's website.
* For tools that generate text - including rewrite tools - include the tool name, the URL, and the *accessed-at* date. For reference, store a screenshot or pdf-printout in [this directory](./).

Failure to properly document third-party resources may be considered a breach of academic integrity. Please err on the side of caution. If text is potentially or possibly copied or generated,  you do want to have the properly time-stamped and complete documentation of your own contributions, versus the contributions of the third party or tool. The alternative is lengthy discussions with the academic integrity officer, something you want to avoid if possible.

Furthermore, note that any resource that you include in your submission, will be your responsibility. You will have to defend any claim  or any recommendation it makes, even if it is from a third-party resource. The same holds to contribution your team members make. It is also your contribution and we may ask about it.

If you want some help on how to properly reference, and how to properly include citation, do not hesitate to contact the [Writing Centre](https://students.mq.edu.au/support/study/writing).
